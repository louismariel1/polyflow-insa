This project is a modified version of the original project polyflow-quickstart at https://github.com/riccardotommasini/polyflow-quickstart
It uses an animal example to simulate continuous querying processing within a Datastream framework. 

The following examples are available in this repository.

1. AnimalStepByStepGuide1.java class: It uses 1 Input Stream, 1 S2R operator, 1 R2R (1 query) and produces 1 Output Stream.
2. AnimalAdvancedGuide1.java class: It uses 2 Input Streams, 2 S2R operators, 2 R2R (2 queries) and produces 1 Output Stream.
3. AnimalAdvancedGuide2.java class: It uses 4 Input Streams, 4 S2R operators, 3 R2R (3 queries) and produces 2 Output Streams.

Abbreviations used herein: S2R = StreamToRelation, R2R = RelationToRelation, R2S = RelationToStream.
